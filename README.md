# MaxMind-Splunk-Lookup
Lookup plugin that enriches IP addresses with data from the MaxMind GeoIP database

geoip2 and maxminddb directories are taken from the Maxmind repositories [https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-python](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-python) and [https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-python](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-python) respectively. They are required in the same directory to make deployment of the app on distributed index servers easier.
